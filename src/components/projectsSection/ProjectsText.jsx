        During my internship, I worked on various projects involving Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, gaining hands-on experience in real-world AI and Machine Learning applications. I also guided fellow interns with their project work, fostering team collaboration. I built a Face Detection project, applying core computer vision techniques. Additionally, I attended multiple expert-led sessions, which enriched my understanding of emerging trends and project-building strategies in the ML domain.
